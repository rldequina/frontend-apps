# vuejs-app

This is a simple Vuejs app that uses vuex state management, element-plus for UI-framework, vue-router, moment.js for date formatting, and Firebase as app's backend solution. One of the features of the app is User Authentication, by having a Signup and Login Page. Upon logging in, Members and Topics stored in Firebase Database will be shown as the landing page. The Members and Topics Page is an implementation of simple CRUD operations, and even like/unlike feature just like in social media apps nowadays. A Logout feature, and a 1-hour logged in timed session for extra security.
